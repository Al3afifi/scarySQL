# commands

This is for my own reference to have quick back access to commands and their uses

'mysql' in bash to start up a connection \
make sure to end every line in mysql with ';'

*show databases;* will only list the database names.\
*create database **name**;* will create a database using that name.

make sure to select the database by inputing `use name;`
